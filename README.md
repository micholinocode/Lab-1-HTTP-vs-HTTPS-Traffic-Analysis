# Lab-1-HTTP-vs-HTTPS-Traffic-Analysis
This lab compares HTTP and HTTPS traffic in Wireshark. HTTP requests and responses appear in plaintext, while HTTPS traffic is encrypted, showing why HTTPS is essential for secure communication.
# Blue Team Labs â€“ Detection & Forensics

This repository documents my hands-on labs and projects as I learn cybersecurity with a focus on Blue Teaming, detection engineering, and network forensics.  
Each lab includes objectives, steps, findings, and key takeaways.
